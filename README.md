Reasoning
1. What design principles guided your improvements?

Mobile-first design: Prioritized small screen readability.

Consistency: Kept a uniform color palette, button styles, and typography.

Clarity: Improved spacing and grouping for readability.

Affordance: Ensured buttons and links look clearly interactive.

2. How did you ensure responsiveness across devices?

Used Bootstrap grid system and media queries.

Tested layout across multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Ensured navigation collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

3. What trade-offs did you make between design and performance?

Chose Bootstrap (slightly larger CSS footprint) for faster development and consistent design patterns.

Avoided heavy animations or large image assets to maintain fast load times.

Kept external dependencies minimal to balance design and performance.

4. What was the most challenging part of the task and how did you approach it?

The main challenge was making the forms intuitive and responsive.

Approach:

Used card layouts to group form elements.

Added proper input spacing, labels, and placeholder hints.

Ensured accessibility with semantic HTML and aria-labels.
